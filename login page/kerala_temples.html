            Ambalappuzha Sree Krishna Swamy Temple is an Indian Hindu temple
            dedicated to Krishna at Ambalappuzha in Alappuzha district of
            Kerala. The temple is believed to have been built during 15th
            century CE by the local ruler Chembakasserry Pooradam
            Thirunal-Devanarayanan Thampuran. It is one of the seven greatest
            temples in Travancore. It is considered one among the 108 Abhimana
            Kshethram of Vaishnavate tradition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idol at Ambalappuzha is likened to Parthasarthi form of Vishnu,
            holding a whip in his right hand and a conch in his left. During the
            raids of Tipu Sultan in 1789, the idol of Sri Krishna from the
            Guruvayoor Temple was brought to the Ambalappuzha Temple for safe
            keeping for three years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payasam, a sweet pudding made of rice and milk is served in the
            temple and is believed that the Lord Guruvayoorappan visits the
            temple daily to accept the offering.

            The Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu in
            Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of the state of Kerala, India. It is
            one of the 108 Divya Desams which are considered the sacred abodes
            of Vishnu in the Sri Vaishnava tradition. The name of the city of
            'Thiruvananthapuram' in Malayalam and Tamil translates to "The City
            of Ananta" (Ananta being a form of Vishnu). The temple is built in
            an intricate fusion of the Kerala style and the Dravidian style of
            architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopuram.
            While as per some traditions the Ananthapura temple in Kumbla in
            Kasaragod district in Kerala is considered as the original spiritual
            seat of the deity ("Mulasthanam"), architecturally to some extent,
            the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in
            Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu. It is widely
            considered the world's richest Hindu temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            The principal deity is Padmanabhaswamy, a form of Vishnu enshrined
            in the "Anantashayana" posture, engaged in eternal yogic sleep on
            his serpent mount, Shesha. Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of
            the Travancore royal family. The titular Maharaja of Travancore,
            Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma, is the current trustee of the temple.

            The Attukal Bhagavathy Temple is a Hindu shrine located at Attukal
            in Kerala, India. It is situated near the heart of the city, two
            kilometres away from the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, East Fort, in
            Thiruvananthapuram. The goddess of the temple is identified with
            Bhadrakali, mounted over a vetala. She is also identified with
            Kannagi, the heroine of Ilango Adigal's epic Cilappatikaram.
          </p>
          <p>
            The temple is renowned for the annual Attukal Pongal festival, in
            which over three million women participate. A festival that has
            figured in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the single
            largest gathering of women for a religious activity, the Attukal
            Pongala continues to draw millions of women with each passing year.
            Devotees believe that all of their wishes are fulfilled by the
            goddess, whose worship can allow them to attain salvation. The
            goddess is often venerated as all three goddesses of the Tridevi:
            Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati.

            Ettumanoor Mahadeva temple is an ancient Shiva temple in Kottayam,
            Kerala, India. Temple tradition has it that the Pandavas and the
            sage Vyasa had worshipped at this temple. The name of the place has
            its origin from the word manoor, which means "the land of deer." The
            temple is one of the major Shiva temples in Kerala, along with
            Vaikom Temple, Chengannur Mahadeva Temple, Kaduthruthy Mahadeva
            Temple, Ernakulam Shiva Temple, Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple,
            Vadakkunathan temple and Sreekanteswaram Mahadeva Temple,
            Thiruvananthapuram.
          </p>
          <p>
            The present temple building, with its gopuram and the fortress
            around it, was reconstructed in 717 ME (1542 AD). There are
            Dravidian mural paintings on the walls inside and outside of the
            main entrance. The fresco of Pradosha Nritham (Dance of Shiva) is
            one of the finest wall paintings in India. There is a golden
            flagstaff inside the temple topped with an idol of a bull surrounded
            by small bells and metal banyan tree leaves. In terms of
            architecture, these temples stand out to be an ultimate testament
            for the Vishwakarma Sthapathis for their engineering skills. The
            temple roofs are covered with copper sheets, and it has 14
            ornamental tops. Bhagavathi, Sastha, Dakshinamoorthy, Ganapathy and
            Yakshi are installed here as subordinate deities. There is a
            separate temple for Lord Krishna. It is believed that the
            philosopher Adi Sankaracharya wrote 'Soundarya Lahari' while staying
            in the temple.

            The Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple is a Hindu temple that is
            devoted to the worship of a deity named Ayyappan, also known as
            Dharma Shasta. Ayyappan is believed to be the son of Shiva and
            Mohini (Female avatar of Lord Vishnu). The temple is situated atop a
            hill in the village of Ranni-Perunad, within the Ranni Taluk of the
            Pathanamthitta district in the state of Kerala, India. The temple is
            surrounded by 18 hills in the Periyar Tiger Reserve. It is one of
            the largest annual pilgrimage sites in the world, with an estimate
            of over 10 to 15 million devotees visiting every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The temple is open for worship only during the days of Mandala Pooja
            (approximately 15 November to 26 December), Makaravilakku or "Makara
            Sankranti" (14 January), and Maha Thirumal Sankranti (14 April), and
            the first five days of each Malayalam month. The Sabarimala
            pilgrimage includes a unique tradition of offering prayer at the
            mosque of Vavar, a Muslim devotee of Ayappan. The Sabarimala Temple
            serves as a prime example of the amalgamation of several religious
            traditions within the Indian context.

            The Vadakkumnathan Temple is an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to
            Shiva in Thrissur, in the Thrissur district of Kerala, India. The
            temple is a classical example of the architectural style of Kerala
            and has one monumental tower on each of the four sides in addition
            to a koothambalam. Mural paintings depicting various scenes from the
            Mahabharata can be seen inside the temple. The shrines and the
            Kuttambalam display vignettes carved in wood. The temple, along with
            the mural paintings, has been declared as a National Monument by
            India under the AMASR Act. According to popular local lore, this is
            the first temple built by Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu.
            Thekkinkadu Maidan, encircling the Vadakkumnathan Temple, is the
            main venue of the renowned Thrissur Pooram festival.f

            In 2012, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has recommended 14
            sites, including Vadakkumnathan Temple and palaces, from Kerala to
            include in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[5] The temple is
            also the first one among the 108 Shiva Temples in ancient Kerala,
            established by Parashurama, and is mentioned in the Shiva Temple
            Stotra as Shrimad-Dakshina Kailasam, meaning 'Mt. Kailash of the
            South'
